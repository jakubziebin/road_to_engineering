This is the part of my enginnering project. Other part is implemented in Zenon software and TIA Portal. The main idea is to choose cheaper source of energy to heat water: gas or electrical. Holt model will help me to forecast prices of gas. I will store datas in postgresql database. I will use OPC UA
